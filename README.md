## Project Summary

Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. In this project, you’ll build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.
You’ll build the complete functionality of this app in two stages which you will submit separately.

## Objectives
Through this project:

* Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
* Allow user to change sort order via a setting:
  * The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
* Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
  * original title
  * movie poster image thumbnail
  * a plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
  * user rating (called vote_average in the api)
  * release date
